# Back Market technical assessment : collect-prepare challenge.

## Configuration

Firstly, clone this GitHub repository on your machine. Then, navigate to the cloned repository and create the project environment from the given environment.yml file.
For example, using the [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) package manager :

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then, open your IDE, open the notebook file and choose the kernel associated to the environment named *back-market-case-study-lin*.

You can now run the notebook. You will find in it an incorporated report where I explain everthing about my first approach of the problem.


*Note* : Once you're done with the notebook, don't forget to remove the environment by running :

```
conda env remove -n back-market-case-study-lin
```

I wish you a good reading ðŸ™‚
